First look at the **C++** programming language and familiarity with the simple **cout** and **cin** commands.\n
Use the **iostream** library to access the cout and cin commands.
In line 3 the program from the command **using namespace std;** It is used for ease of work in the coding section, because if this line is deleted, for each command in the next lines, you must first write **std::** which will be annoying in long programs.
The other part of the first look is related to getting acquainted with the types of variables and taking input from the user with the cin command and placing it in the desired variable.
**int, unsigned int, signed int, short int, unsigned short int, signed short int, long int, signed long int, unsigned long int:**
    For integers according to the required range
**float, double, long double:**
    For reference numbers according to the required range
**char, unsigned char, signed char:**
    For characters (unicodes, letters of the alphabet, etc.)
**wchar_t:**
    For storing large characters with high range
**string:**
    To store strings
